Based on earleir code versions by Piero Visconti (UCL-CEBR, pierovisconti@gmail.com)

Small R code estimating for various land cover use input files (see sample files in input_scenarios folder) a few biodiversity indices (Red List Index RLI, extent of suitable habitat ESHI, potential number of species, number of species already extinct in the first year) for 2843 mammal species, and for the AgMIP regions.

The code is based on a particular land use delineation:
- 2 by 2 degree regular lat-lon grid with pixels identified 'ID_LUID' in the input files.
- a delineation of land in 9 land cover/use categories for which P Visconti mapped the suitability of each land cover for each species.

The two core indices are RLI and ESHI, while the two other variables 

Differences to previous code versions include:
- slightly adapting (name of output & input files) & running the script from R console or RStudio (I did not check, but should work from command line as well).
- the output is saved in a file (by default in the output folder) instead of outputed as text to the user
- the values are computed for the various AgMIP regions
- the use of a slightly revised code to estimate RLI index based upon A2 criteria (revision done by Piero Visconti to accomodate for the case in which some species already no suitable area alerady in the first year - they will be counted as extinct for all years).
